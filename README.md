# File-Based CMS Project

### Overview:

This project is a simple CRUD CMS web application built in Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, and CSS. It was developed as part of Launch School's RB175 course.

The goals of the project were to teach students:

* Translating high-level requirements into an implementation plan
* Translating an implementation plan into actual lines of code
* Writing tests that verify the behavior of an application
* And finally, to build a web app that allows users to view, edit, and create documents... as well as signing in and out of the site.

My focus when building the project was on the back-end code. I may go add some more CSS and HTML in the future to make the site easier on the eyes.

### User Actions:

Site users have the ability to:

* Log in to the site and logout
* View list of all added files that are stored in the Data folder
* Edit existing files
* Delete existing files
* Add new files
* View an individual file
